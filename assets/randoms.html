        <q><i>Good design results in good products</i></q>
        <br /><br />
        I periodically do graphic design for clients or individual purposes.
        <br /><br />
        Throughout my coding journey, I have utilised various design softwares such as
        Adobe products(InDesign, Photoshop & XD). I am currently exploring other 
        non-commercial & open source design softwares like Figma & PenPot.
        <br /><br />
        Here are some of my designs... I strive to improve. üòâ
